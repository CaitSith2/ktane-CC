            <h2>On the Subject of Caesar Cipher</h2>
            <p class="flavour-text">
					The Roman warlord Caesar had his own personal way to encrypt his data. We could think about him as the father of the modern cryptography. But you are a qualified soldier so you won't have problems in decoding our message, don't you?
			</p>

			<p> You are given an encrypted word. Decrypt it, write it in the second box and press OK to solve the module.<br>To decrypt the word start by finding the key.<br>Add every digit on the serial and then, referring to "Letter-Number Relation" below, follow those cases to find your word.</p>
			<!-- Here are some examples of tables that we use in the manual that you can use if it makes sense -->
			<!-- Wires table -->
			<table>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td><strong><em>Case 01: The serial number contains a vowel:</em></strong><br>
						Every letter of the word must be shifted backwards by the key<br>
						Keep in mind that if you go under the 0, the next number will be 26
						because numbers go only from 0 to 26.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><strong><em>Case 02: The bomb contains more than 3 batteries:</em></strong><br>
						Every letter of the word must be shifted forwards by the key<br>
						Keep in mind that if you go over the 26, the next number will be 0
						because numbers go only from 0 to 26.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><strong><em>Case 03: There is a serial port:</em></strong><br>
						If this is your first word, refer to Case 01, otherwise go on.<br>
						Add to the key the number of letters of the last word you decrypted,
						then proceed as like as in Case 01.<br>
						Keep in mind that if you go under the 0, the next number will be 26
						because numbers go only from 0 to 26.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><strong><em>Case 04: You committed strikes:</em></strong><br>
						If this is your first word, refer to Case 02, otherwise go on.<br>
						Add to the key the number corrisponding to each letter of the last word you decrypted,
						then proceed as like as in Case 02.
						Every letter of the word must be shifted forwards by the rest of the division
						between his Letter-Number Relation and the key.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><strong><em>Case 05: None of the previous case matches:</em></strong><br>
					The word is not encrypted, just type it as you see it and press OK.</td>
					</tr>
